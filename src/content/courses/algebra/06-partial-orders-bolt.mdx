# The Hierarchy Mental Model

A **partial order** creates a hierarchy — like a family tree, organizational chart, or divisibility lattice. Some elements are "above" others, but not everything is comparable.

$$
\begin{array}{c}
12 \\
\diagup \quad \diagdown \\
4 \quad\quad 6 \\
\diagdown \quad \diagup \\
2 \quad 3 \\
\diagdown \diagup \\
1
\end{array}
$$

Think: **1 divides 2, 2 divides 4, but 4 and 6 are incomparable** (neither divides the other).

## The Three Requirements

### 1. Reflexive: "I'm at least as good as myself"

Every element is related to itself. $a \leq a$.

$$\forall a: (a, a) \in R$$

**Matrix Check:** Diagonal is all **1s**.

### 2. Antisymmetric: "No ties (except with yourself)"

If $a \leq b$ AND $b \leq a$, then $a = b$. No two *distinct* elements can both be "above" each other.

$$(a, b) \in R \land (b, a) \in R \Rightarrow a = b$$

**Matrix Check:** If $M_{ij} = 1$ where $i \neq j$, then $M_{ji} = 0$.

### 3. Transitive: "If a ≤ b ≤ c, then a ≤ c"

The hierarchy chains correctly.

$$(a, b) \in R \land (b, c) \in R \Rightarrow (a, c) \in R$$

<MultipleChoice
  question="Which matrix represents a partial order on $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$?"
  options={[
    "$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ — Upper triangular",
    "$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ — Symmetric blocks",
    "$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ — Has a cycle",
    "$\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ — Strict order"
  ]}
  correct={0}
  explanation="Upper triangular with 1s on diagonal is the classic partial order pattern. The symmetric one is an equivalence relation (fails antisymmetry). The cycle one fails transitivity. The last fails reflexivity."

## Partial Order vs. Equivalence Relation

| Partial Order | Equivalence Relation |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Reflexive ✓ | Reflexive ✓ |
| **Antisymmetric** | **Symmetric** |
| Transitive ✓ | Transitive ✓ |
| Creates **hierarchy** | Creates **partitions** |
| Example: $\leq$, $\subseteq$, divides | Example: $=$, $\equiv \pmod{n}$ |

**The key difference:** Antisymmetric vs. Symmetric. They're opposite conditions!

<MultipleChoice
  question="Can a relation be BOTH an equivalence relation AND a partial order?"
  options={[
    "No, never",
    "Yes, but only the empty relation",
    "Yes, only the identity relation (equality)",
    "Yes, any reflexive relation"
  ]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="To be both symmetric AND antisymmetric, the only off-diagonal pairs allowed are... none! This leaves only the identity relation where $aRb \\iff a = b$."
/>

## Hasse Diagrams: The Clean Picture

A **Hasse diagram** strips away redundant information:

1. **No loops** — Reflexivity is assumed (everything relates to itself)
2. **No transitive edges** — If $a < b < c$, don't draw $a \to c$
3. **Direction implied** — Larger elements are drawn *above* smaller ones

### Drawing Rules

$$
\text{Full Graph} \quad \longrightarrow \quad \text{Hasse Diagram}
$$

Remove:
- Self-loops (implied by reflexivity)
- "Shortcut" edges (implied by transitivity)
- Arrows (direction is "up")

<MultipleChoice
  question="In a Hasse diagram for divisibility on $\\{2, 4, 6, 12\\}$, is there a direct edge from 2 to 12?"
  options={[
    "Yes, because 2 | 12",
    "No, because 2 | 4 | 12 (go through 4)",
    "No, because 2 | 6 | 12 (go through 6)",
    "Both B and C (either path works)"
  ]}
  correct={3}
  explanation="Both paths exist: $2 \\to 4 \\to 12$ and $2 \\to 6 \\to 12$. Since intermediate elements exist, we don't draw the direct edge $2 \\to 12$."
/>

---

## Special Elements

### Minimal vs. Least

- **Minimal**: Nothing is *strictly below* it (could be multiple)
- **Least (Minimum)**: Below *everything else* (unique if exists)

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\text{Divisibility on } \{2, 3, 6\}: \\
2 \quad 3 \quad \text{(both minimal)} \\
\quad \diagdown \diagup \\
\quad\quad 6
\end{array}
$$

No *least* element exists (2 and 3 are incomparable).

<MultipleChoice
  question="In the poset of divisibility on $\\{2, 3, 4, 6, 12\\}$, what are the minimal elements?"
  options={[
    "Just 2",
    "Just 2 and 3",
    "2, 3, and 4",
    "12"
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="2 and 3 have nothing below them in this set. 4 has 2 below it. 6 has 2 and 3 below it. 12 is maximal, not minimal."
/>

### Maximal vs. Greatest

Same idea, but "above":
- **Maximal**: Nothing is *strictly above* it
- **Greatest (Maximum)**: Above *everything else*

<MultipleChoice
  question="Does the poset $\\{1, 2, 4, 8\\}$ under divisibility have a greatest element?"
  options={[
    "Yes, it's 1",
    "Yes, it's 8",
    "No, 4 and 8 are both maximal",
    "No greatest element exists"
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="This is a chain: $1 | 2 | 4 | 8$. Every element is comparable! 8 divides nothing else, and everything divides 8. So 8 is the greatest (and only maximal) element."
/>

## Bounds: LUB and GLB

For a subset $S$ of a poset:

### Upper Bound
An element $u$ such that $\forall s \in S: s \leq u$.

### Lower Bound  
An element $l$ such that $\forall s \in S: l \leq s$.

### LUB (Least Upper Bound / Supremum / Join)
The *smallest* upper bound. Written $\sup(S)$ or $\bigvee S$.

### GLB (Greatest Lower Bound / Infimum / Meet)
The *largest* lower bound. Written $\inf(S)$ or $\bigwedge S$.

<MultipleChoice
  question="In divisibility on $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\\}$, what is $\\text{LUB}(\\{2, 3\\})$?"
  options={[
    "1",
    "6",
    "12",
    "Does not exist"
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="Upper bounds of $\\{2, 3\\}$ are elements divisible by both: $\\{6, 12\\}$. The smallest is 6. (This is the LCM!)"
/>

<MultipleChoice
  question="In divisibility on $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\\}$, what is $\\text{GLB}(\\{4, 6\\})$?"
  options={[
    "1",
    "2",
    "12",
    "Does not exist"
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="Lower bounds of $\\{4, 6\\}$ are elements that divide both: $\\{1, 2\\}$. The largest is 2. (This is the GCD!)"
/>

---

## Lattices: When LUB and GLB Always Exist

A poset where every pair has both a LUB and GLB is called a **lattice**.

**Examples:**
- Divisibility on divisors of $n$ — always a lattice
- Power set with $\subseteq$ — always a lattice (LUB = union, GLB = intersection)
- $\mathbb{Z}$ with $\leq$ — a lattice (it's a total order!)

<MultipleChoice
  question="Is divisibility on $\\{2, 3, 4, 6\\}$ a lattice?"
  options={[
    "Yes",
    "No — $\\text{GLB}(2, 3)$ doesn't exist",
    "No — $\\text{LUB}(4, 6)$ doesn't exist",
    "No — both B and C"
  ]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="GLB(2,3) would be GCD(2,3)=1, but 1 isn't in the set! Also, LUB(4,6)=12 isn't in the set. Both bounds missing means it's not a lattice."
/>

## Cover Relations

$a$ **covers** $b$ (written $a \lessdot b$ or $b \gtrdot a$) means:
- $a < b$ (a is strictly below b)
- No element $c$ exists with $a < c < b$

These are the edges we draw in a Hasse diagram!

<MultipleChoice
  question="In divisibility on $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16\\}$, what covers 4?"
  options={[
    "2 and 8",
    "Just 8",
    "Just 2",
    "1, 2, 8, and 16"
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="2 is below 4 (2 | 4), so 2 doesn't cover 4 — 4 covers 2! 8 is the only element with $4 | 8$ and no element strictly between. 16 has 8 between it and 4."
