# The Matrix View

We can represent any relation $R$ on a finite set $A$ as a **boolean matrix** $M$.
If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$, then $M_{ij} = 1$ if $(i, j) \in R$, and $0$ otherwise.

$$
M = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

This matrix allows us to spot properties visually.

## Reflexive: The Diagonal

A relation is **Reflexive** if every element relates to itself ($\forall a, (a,a) \in R$).
In the matrix, this means the **main diagonal** is all 1s.

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{1} & 0 & 1 \\
0 & \mathbf{1} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \mathbf{1}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

<MultipleChoice
  question="Is the relation with matrix $$ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} $$ reflexive?"
  options={[
    "Yes, the top-left is 1",
    "No, the entry (2,2) is 0",
    "No, it is not symmetric"
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="Reflexive requires ALL diagonal entries to be 1. Here, the bottom-right diagonal entry is 0."

## Symmetric: The Fold

A relation is **Symmetric** if $(a,b) \in R \implies (b,a) \in R$.
In the matrix, this means it is a mirror image across the main diagonal. If you **fold** the matrix along the diagonal, the 1s must match up.

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \mathbf{1} & 0 \\
\mathbf{1} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

<MultipleChoice
  question="Is the relation with matrix $$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} $$ symmetric?"
  options={[
    "Yes, it looks simple",
    "No, (1,2) is 1 but (2,1) is 0",
    "No, the diagonal is 0"
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="Symmetry requires that for every 1 off the diagonal, its mirror image must also be 1. Here (1,2) has no matching pair at (2,1)."

## Antisymmetric: One-Way Streets

A relation is **Antisymmetric** if you never have traffic going BOTH ways between distinct nodes.
In the matrix: If $M_{ij} = 1$ (where $i \neq j$), then $M_{ji}$ MUST be 0.

You can have 1s on the diagonal. You can have 0s on both sides. But you cannot have 1s on both sides.

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \mathbf{1} & 0 \\
\mathbf{0} & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

<MultipleChoice
  question="Is the relation with matrix $$ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} $$ antisymmetric?"
  options={[
    "Yes, it is full",
    "No, (1,2) and (2,1) are both 1",
    "No, the diagonal has 1s"
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="Antisymmetry FORBIDS having 1s at both (1,2) and (2,1). Since both are 1, it fails."
/>

## Transitive: The Shortcut

A relation is **Transitive** if $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,c) \in R \implies (a,c) \in R$.
Visually: If you can get from $i$ to $k$ in two steps ($i \to j \to k$), there must be a direct flight ($i \to k$).

<MultipleChoice
  question="Is the relation with matrix $$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} $$ transitive?"
  options={[
    "Yes, it has no cycles",
    "No, (1,2) and (2,3) exist, but (1,3) is missing",
    "No, the diagonal is 0"
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="We have a path 1 -> 2 -> 3. Transitivity requires the shortcut 1 -> 3 to exist. It does not (entry is 0), so it fails."

## Classifications

Combining these properties gives us two major structures:

1.  **Equivalence Relation**: Reflexive + Symmetric + Transitive.
    *   Examples: "Is equal to", "Has same color as", "Is congruent to".
    *   Think: Partitions the set into groups.

2.  **Partial Order**: Reflexive + Antisymmetric + Transitive.
    *   Examples: $\leq$, $\subseteq$, "Is an ancestor of".
    *   Think: Hierarchy or ordering.
