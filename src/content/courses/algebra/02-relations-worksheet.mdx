  <Fragment slot="question">Describe $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">The set of all possible ordered pairs where both the first and second elements are integers.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
The **Cartesian product** $A \times B$ is simply the set of all possible combinations $(a, b)$ where $a$ comes from set $A$ and $b$ comes from set $B$.

In this specific case, both sets are $\mathbb{Z}$ (the integers: ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...).

So, $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ contains every pair $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are integers.

**Visual Intuition:**
If you imagine a 2D graph, this set represents all the "grid points" — the points where the vertical and horizontal grid lines cross.

  <Fragment slot="question">How many relations are there from set $A$ to set $B$ where $|A|=m, |B|=n$?</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">$2^{mn}$</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
Let's break this down step-by-step:

1.  **What is a relation?**
    A relation from $A$ to $B$ is defined as _any_ subset of the Cartesian product $A \times B$. This means any collection of pairs from $A \times B$ counts as a relation.

2.  **How big is the Cartesian product?**
    Since we have $m$ choices for the first element and $n$ choices for the second, the total number of pairs is $|A \times B| = m \times n$.

3.  **How many subsets are there?**
    For any set with $k$ elements, the number of possible subsets (including the empty set and the set itself) is $2^k$. This is called the Power Set.

**Conclusion:**
Since our "set of pairs" has size $mn$, the number of possible subsets—and thus the number of possible relations—is $2^{mn}$.

  <Fragment slot="question">Is $f(x) = \frac{x}{x+1}$ invertible?</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">Yes.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
To check if a function is invertible, we primarily need to check if it is **one-to-one (injective)**. This means that no two *different* inputs ($x$) give the same output ($y$).

**The Test:**
Assume we have two inputs, $a$ and $b$, that give the same result: $f(a) = f(b)$. If we can prove that $a$ _must_ equal $b$, then the function is one-to-one.

$$ \frac{a}{a+1} = \frac{b}{b+1} $$

Cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions:
$$ a(b+1) = b(a+1) $$

Expand both sides:
$$ ab + a = ab + b $$

Subtract $ab$ from both sides:
$$ a = b $$

**Conclusion:**
Since assuming $f(a)=f(b)$ leads directly to $a=b$, the function is injective. It maps every input to a unique output, so we can reverse it perfectly. It is invertible.

  <Fragment slot="question">For which $a \in \mathbb{R}$ is $f(x)=ax$ invertible? Find $f^{-1}$.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">$a \neq 0$. Inverse: $f^{-1}(y) = \frac{y}{a}$.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
**Part 1: When is it invertible?**
For a function to be invertible, we must be able to uniquely determine the input $x$ given an output $y$.
$$ y = ax $$
To solve for $x$, we would divide by $a$:
$$ x = \frac{y}{a} $$
This operation is valid *only* if **$a \neq 0$**. If $a=0$, then $f(x)=0$ for *all* $x$, meaning we can't tell which $x$ produced the output (infinite-to-one mapping).

**Part 2: Finding the Inverse**
The inverse function $f^{-1}$ essentially "undoes" what $f$ did.

1.  Start with $y = ax$
2.  Swap $x$ and $y$ (standard technique for finding inverse formulas): $x = ay$
3.  Solve for the new $y$:
    $$ y = \frac{x}{a} $$

So, $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x}{a}$.

  <Fragment slot="question">Investigate properties of $R_5$ on $\mathbb{Z}$: $(x,y) \in R_5 \iff 5 \mid (x-y)$.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">Equivalence Relation (Reflexive, Symmetric, Transitive).</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
This notation $5 \mid (x-y)$ means "$x$ minus $y$ is a multiple of 5". This is also known as "congruence modulo 5". Let's check the three properties for an **Equivalence Relation**:

1.  **Reflexive (Does every number relate to itself?)**
    We test $(x, x)$. Is $x - x$ divisible by 5?
    $x - x = 0$. Since $0 = 5 \times 0$, yes, 5 divides 0.
    **Status: Reflexive.**

2.  **Symmetric (Is the relation a two-way street?)**
    If $(x, y)$ is in the relation, does $(y, x)$ have to be?
    Assume $x - y = 5k$ (a multiple of 5).
    Then $y - x = -(x - y) = -5k = 5(-k)$.
    Since $-k$ is still an integer, $y - x$ is also a multiple of 5.
    **Status: Symmetric.**

3.  **Transitive (Does it chain together?)**
    If $x$ relates to $y$, and $y$ relates to $z$, does $x$ relate to $z$?
    Assume $x - y = 5k$ and $y - z = 5j$.
    Let's add these equations:
    $(x - y) + (y - z) = 5k + 5j$
    $x - z = 5(k + j)$
    So $x - z$ is indeed a multiple of 5.
    **Status: Transitive.**

Since it satisfies all three, it is an **Equivalence Relation**.

<WorksheetProblem number={6}>
  <Fragment slot="question">Is $=$ an equivalence relation?</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">Yes.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
Equality is the "prototypical" equivalence relation. All other equivalence relations try to mimic equality in some way.

1.  **Reflexive:** Is $a = a$? **Yes**, obviously.
2.  **Symmetric:** If $a = b$, is $b = a$? **Yes**.
3.  **Transitive:** If $a = b$ and $b = c$, is $a = c$? **Yes**.

Therefore, it is an equivalence relation.

<WorksheetProblem number={7}>
  <Fragment slot="question">Is $>$ an equivalence relation?</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">No.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
Let's test the properties:

1.  **Reflexive:** Is $a > a$? **No**. A number is never strictly greater than itself.

We can stop right there. Since it fails the first test, it cannot be an equivalence relation.

(Note: It is Transitive ($a>b \land b>c \implies a>c$), but it fails Reflexive and Symmetric).

</WorksheetProblem>

<WorksheetProblem number={8}>
  <Fragment slot="question">Is $\geq$ an equivalence relation?</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">No.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
Let's test the properties:

1.  **Reflexive:** Is $a \geq a$? **Yes**.
2.  **Symmetric:** If $a \geq b$, does that mean $b \geq a$?
    Let's try an example: $5 \geq 2$ is true.
    But is $2 \geq 5$? **No**.

Since it fails symmetry, it is **not** an equivalence relation.

(Note: Because it is Reflexive, Antisymmetric, and Transitive, it is actually a **Partial Order**).

  <Fragment slot="answer">(a) $A = \{2, 4, ..., 30\}$. (b) Union and Intersection details below.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
**(a) Constructing Set A**
We need positive integers up to 30 that are divisible by 2 (even numbers).
$A = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30\}$

**(b) Filtering Subsets**

- **Set B (Multiples of 6):** Look at $A$ and pick numbers divisible by 6.
  $B = \{6, 12, 18, 24, 30\}$
- **Set C (Multiples of 8):** Look at $A$ and pick numbers divisible by 8.
  $C = \{8, 16, 24\}$

**Calculating Operations**

- **Union ($B \cup C$):** "Combine everyone together". List every number that appears in _either_ B or C (don't repeat duplicates).
  $B \cup C = \{6, 8, 12, 16, 18, 24, 30\}$
- **Intersection ($B \cap C$):** "Find the common ground". List only numbers that appear in _both_ sets.
  Only 24 is in both lists.
  $B \cap C = \{24\}$

  <Fragment slot="question">$R$ on $M_{n \times n}$: $(A,B) \in R \iff A = PBP^{-1}$ (Similarity). Is $R$ an equivalence relation?</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">Yes.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
This relates to Linear Algebra. Two matrices are "similar" if they represent the same linear transformation just viewed from different bases (coordinate systems).

Let's check the properties formally:

1.  **Reflexive:** Is $A$ similar to itself?
    We need $A = P A P^{-1}$. If we choose $P$ to be the Identity matrix ($I$), then $I A I^{-1} = A$.
    **Yes.**

2.  **Symmetric:** If $A$ is similar to $B$, is $B$ similar to $A$?
    Given $A = P B P^{-1}$, we can solve for $B$.
    Multiply left by $P^{-1}$ and right by $P$:
    $P^{-1} A P = B$
    This looks like the same form: $B = Q A Q^{-1}$ where $Q = P^{-1}$.
    **Yes.**

3.  **Transitive:** If $A$ similar to $B$, and $B$ similar to $C$...
    $A = P B P^{-1}$
    $B = Q C Q^{-1}$
    Substitute the second equation into the first:
    $A = P (Q C Q^{-1}) P^{-1} = (PQ) C (Q^{-1}P^{-1}) = (PQ) C (PQ)^{-1}$
    So $A$ is similar to $C$ using the change-of-basis matrix $PQ$.
    **Yes.**

**Conclusion:** It is an equivalence relation.

  <Fragment slot="question">$A = \text{webpages}$, $(a,b) \in R \iff \exists$ common link. What are the properties of $R$?</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">Reflexive and Symmetric. Not Transitive.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
Let's translate "common link": Two pages are related if they both link to the same third page (or pages).

1.  **Reflexive:** Does page $a$ have a common link with itself?
    Yes, assuming the page links to _something_, it shares those links with itself.

2.  **Symmetric:** If $a$ and $b$ share a link, do $b$ and $a$ share a link?
    Yes, obviously. "Sharing" is mutual.

3.  **Transitive:** This is the tricky one.
    - Page $A$ links to Google.
    - Page $B$ links to Google AND Facebook.
    - Page $C$ links to Facebook.
    
    $A$ and $B$ relate (share Google).
    $B$ and $C$ relate (share Facebook).
    **BUT** $A$ and $C$ share nothing!

    So the relation is **NOT Transitive**.

  <Fragment slot="question">$A=\{1,2\}$, $R$ on $2^A$: $(B,C) \in R \iff B \subseteq C$. (a) Write the matrix $M_R$. (b) What are the properties?</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">(a) See derivation for matrix. (b) Partial Order.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
**(a) Constructing the Matrix**
First, list all elements of the power set $2^A$ (all subsets of $\{1,2\}$):
Elements: $\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1,2\}$. Let's number them 1 to 4.

We put a 1 in the matrix at $(Row, Col)$ if $Row \subseteq Col$.

- $\emptyset$ is a subset of everything. (Row 1 is all 1s).
- $\{1\}$ is a subset of itself and $\{1,2\}$.
- $\{2\}$ is a subset of itself and $\{1,2\}$.
- $\{1,2\}$ is a subset of only itself.

$$M_R = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

**(b) Properties**

- **Reflexive:** Diagonal is all 1s (Every set contains itself).
- **Antisymmetric:** No symmetry across the diagonal. If $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$, then $A=B$.
- **Transitive:** If $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq C$, then $A \subseteq C$.

A relation with these three properties is called a **Partial Order**.

  <Fragment slot="question">$A=\{a,b,c\}$ with given matrix $M_R$. Find: (a) $R^{-1}$, (b) $\overline{R}$, (c) $R^2$.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">(a) $R^{-1} = R$. (b) Complement details below. (c) Universal relation.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
Given Matrix:
$$M_R = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

**(a) Inverse Relation $R^{-1}$**
To find the inverse, we transpose the matrix (swap rows and columns).
Looking at $M_R$, it is **symmetric** (it looks the same if you flip it over the diagonal).
Therefore, its transpose is identical to itself.
$R^{-1} = R$.

**(b) Complement $\overline{R}$**
The complement is "everything NOT in the relation". We flip 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s.
$$ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} $$
This corresponds to the pairs $\{(a,a), (b,c), (c,b)\}$.

**(c) Composition $R^2$**
This corresponds to matrix multiplication (using Boolean logic: $1+1=1$).
If you multiply $M_R \times M_R$, you are checking "Can I get from $i$ to $j$ in exactly 2 hops?".
In this graph, you can reach any node from any other node in 2 steps.
Thus, the result is a matrix of all 1s (the **Universal Relation**).

  <Fragment slot="question">Determine if $R_1$ and $R_2$ are equivalence relations given their matrices.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">$R_1$: No. $R_2$: Yes.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
**Visual Checks for Equivalence Relations:**
1.  **Reflexive:** The main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) must be all 1s.
2.  **Symmetric:** The matrix must look identical if folded along the diagonal.

**Analyzing $R_1$:**
Check symmetry. Look at row 1, col 2 vs row 2, col 1.
If $m_{12} \neq m_{21}$, it's not symmetric.
Since it fails symmetry, it is **not** an equivalence relation.

**Analyzing $R_2$:**

- Diagonal is all 1s? **Yes**. (Reflexive)
- Symmetric? **Yes**.
- Transitive? We look for "block" structures.
  Nodes 1, 2, 3 form a solid $3 \times 3$ block of 1s (they are all connected to each other).
  Node 4 is isolated (only connected to itself).
  This "islands of connected nodes" structure is the signature of an equivalence relation.
  **Yes**, it is an equivalence relation.

  <Fragment slot="question">$R$: Direct flights between cities. What do $R^2$, $R^3$, and $R^{-1}$ represent?</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">$R^2$: 1 stopover. $R^3$: 2 stopovers. $R^{-1}$: Return flights.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
Think of $R$ as "can fly directly".

**(a) $R^2$ (Composition $R \circ R$)**
$(a,c) \in R^2$ means there exists some intermediate city $b$ such that $a \to b$ AND $b \to c$.
In plain English: You flew from $a$ to $c$ with **exactly one stopover**.

**(b) $R^3$ ($R \circ R \circ R$)**
This adds another link to the chain: $a \to b \to c \to d$.
This represents flights with **exactly two stopovers**.

**(c) $R^{-1}$ (Inverse)**
$(a,b) \in R^{-1}$ is the pair $(b,a)$ from the original relation.
If $R$ is "flight from $a$ to $b$", then $R^{-1}$ is "flight from $b$ to $a$".
This represents the **return flight**.

  <Fragment slot="question">Find the reflexive closure of $R = \{(a,b) \in \mathbb{Z}^2 \mid a \neq b\}$.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">The universal relation $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
**What is a Reflexive Closure?**
It means taking a relation and adding the *minimum* number of pairs needed to make it reflexive.
To be reflexive, we need every element to relate to itself: we need $(a,a)$ for every integer $a$.

**Current Relation:**
$R$ contains every pair $(a,b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are _different_.

**The Fix:**
We add all pairs where $a$ and $b$ are the _same_ ($\Delta = \{(a,a)\}$).

**Result:**
If you have "all pairs where distinct" AND "all pairs where same", you essentially have **all possible pairs**.
The result is the full Cartesian product $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$.

  <Fragment slot="derivation">
**What is a Symmetric Closure?**
It means ensuring that for every arrow $a \to b$, there is a return arrow $b \to a$.
In set terms, it is $R \cup R^{-1}$.

**Analysis:**

- $R$ is "a divides b" (e.g., $(2,6)$ is in $R$).
- $R^{-1}$ is the reverse: "b divides a" (e.g., $(6,2)$ is in $R^{-1}$).

**Result:**
The union contains pairs where EITHER $a$ divides $b$ OR $b$ divides $a$.
This doesn't simplify to a neat name, so we describe it as the set of pairs where one number divides the other.

  <Fragment slot="answer">Students connected by a common classmate.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
Let's trace the path logic:
$(a,c) \in R^2$ means there exists a person $b$ such that:
1.  $a$ shares a class with $b$.
2.  $b$ shares a class with $c$.

So, $a$ and $c$ might not know each other directly, but they have a mutual classmate ($b$).
$R^2$ represents the relationship "We have a friend-of-a-friend (classmate-wise)."

  <Fragment slot="question">Find the transitive closure $R^*$ using Warshall's algorithm.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">Nodes 1, 2, 3 become fully connected.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
Transitive closure is about finding **reachability**: "Can I get from A to B *eventually*?"

**Analyzing the Graph:**

- $1 \to 3$
- $3 \to 2$
- $2 \to 1$
- $1 \to 4$

Notice the cycle: $1 \to 3 \to 2 \to 1$.
In a transitive closure, if you are in a cycle, everyone in that cycle can reach everyone else.
So $\{1, 2, 3\}$ becomes a "clique" (fully connected block of 1s in the matrix).

**Node 4:**
Node 4 is reachable from 1 (and thus from 2 and 3 via 1), but Node 4 has no outgoing edges.

**Resulting Matrix:**
The top $3 \times 3$ block will be all 1s.
The column for 4 will have 1s in rows 1, 2, 3 (because 1, 2, and 3 can all reach 4).
Row 4 will be all 0s (4 can't go anywhere).

  <Fragment slot="answer">Yes.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
(See Problem 10 for the detailed proof).

In short:

1.  **Reflexive:** Any matrix is similar to itself (via Identity matrix).
2.  **Symmetric:** If A is similar to B, B is similar to A (via Inverse matrix).
3.  **Transitive:** Similarity chains together (via Matrix Multiplication).

Yes, it is a classic example of an equivalence relation in Linear Algebra.

  <Fragment slot="question">Bit strings: $s \sim t \iff \#_1(s) = \#_1(t)$ (same number of 1s). (a) Is this an equivalence relation? (b) How many strings of length $n$ have exactly two 1s?</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">(a) Yes. (b) $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
**(a) Equivalence Check**
Think about what this relation does: it groups strings into buckets based on "how many 1s they have".
*   Does $s$ have the same number of 1s as $s$? **Yes.**
*   If $s$ has same count as $t$, does $t$ have same count as $s$? **Yes.**
*   If count($s$) = count($t$) and count($t$) = count($u$), is count($s$) = count($u$)? **Yes.**
So, yes, it is an equivalence relation.

**(b) Combinatorics**
We have a string of length $n$ (n empty slots).
We need to place exactly two '1's.

- Pick a slot for the first '1': $n$ choices.
- Pick a slot for the second '1': $n-1$ choices.
- Total ways = $n(n-1)$.
- **Wait!** The order doesn't matter (picking slot 3 then 5 is same as 5 then 3). So we divide by 2.

Formula: $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.

  <Fragment slot="question">Rationals: $(a,b) \sim (c,d) \iff ad = bc$. Is this an equivalence relation?</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">Yes.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
This looks abstract, but it's actually how we define fractions!
Think of pair $(a,b)$ as the fraction $\frac{a}{b}$.
The condition $ad = bc$ is just cross-multiplication for $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$.

So the question really asks: "Is equality of fractions an equivalence relation?"
Since it models the concept of "equal value", the answer is naturally **Yes**.

We can verify technically:

- Reflexive: $ab = ba$ (True).
- Symmetric: If $ad=bc$, then $cb=da$ (True).
- Transitive: Requires a bit of algebra, but holds true.

  <Fragment slot="question">Determine which of the given matrices represent partial orderings.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="answer">Matrix (b) and (c).</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
**Recall: Partial Order Properties**
1.  **Reflexive:** Diagonal must be all 1s.
2.  **Antisymmetric:** If $m_{ij}=1$ (where $i \neq j$), then $m_{ji}$ MUST be 0. No two-way streets off the diagonal.
3.  **Transitive:** If $i \to j$ and $j \to k$, then $i \to k$.

**Analysis:**

- **Matrix (a):** Has $1$ at $(1,2)$ and $1$ at $(2,1)$. This violates Antisymmetry. **No.**
- **Matrix (b):** Diagonal is 1s. It is "Upper Triangular" (all 1s are above diagonal), which guarantees Antisymmetry automatically. It also checks out for transitivity. **Yes.**
- **Matrix (c):** Diagonal is 1s. No symmetric entries. Transitivity holds. **Yes.**

  <Fragment slot="answer">See derivation for the diagram edges.</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="derivation">
A **Hasse Diagram** is a clean way to draw a Partial Order.
Rules:
1.  Higher numbers go above lower numbers.
2.  Don't draw loops (reflexivity is implied).
3.  Don't draw "shortcut" lines if a path already exists (transitivity is implied). e.g., if $2 \to 4$ and $4 \to 12$, don't draw $2 \to 12$.

**Step-by-Step Construction:**

1.  **Start at the bottom (numbers that nothing divides):**
    2 and 5 are the "roots".

2.  **Level 2 (What do 2 and 5 divide directly?):**

    - $2$ divides $4$ and $10$.
    - $5$ divides $10$ and $25$.
