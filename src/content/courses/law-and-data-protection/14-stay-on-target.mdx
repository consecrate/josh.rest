# Function Creep

Bob has a great idea.
"We have 10,000 phone numbers collected for Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)," he says.
"Why don't we use them to send SMS ads? It's a goldmine!"

Alice shakes her head. "That's **Function Creep**, Bob. And it's illegal."

## Purpose Limitation

**Article 5(1)(b)** states that data must be:
1.  Collected for **specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes**.
2.  Not further processed in a manner that is **incompatible** with those purposes.

Translation: **You have to stick to the plan.**
If you collected data for Purpose A (Security), you cannot just switch to Purpose B (Marketing) whenever you feel like it.

## The Compatibility Test

Can you *ever* change purposes? Yes, but only if the new purpose is **Compatible**.
To decide, ask:
*   **Link**: Is there a strong link between the original and new purpose?
*   **Context**: What is the relationship between you and the user?
*   **Nature**: Is the data sensitive?
*   **Consequences**: Will this hurt the user?
*   **Safeguards**: Is the data encrypted or anonymized?

### Examples
*   **Compatible**: Using shipping data to calculate average delivery times (Stats).
*   **Compatible**: Using medical records for scientific research (with safeguards).
*   **Incompatible**: Using 2FA numbers for Marketing (Users didn't expect this).
*   **Incompatible**: Using security CCTV to spy on employee breaks.

## The Research Exception

The GDPR loves science. Processing for **archiving in the public interest, scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes** is *always* considered compatible (Article 5(1)(b)), provided you have safeguards (like anonymization).

<MultipleChoice
  question="DataVault wants to use its user logs to train a Machine Learning model to detect general hacking patterns. They anonymize the data first. Is this 'Function Creep'?"
  options={[
    "Yes, it's a new purpose.",
    "No, statistical/scientific research is considered 'Compatible' (with safeguards).",
    "Yes, unless every user agrees.",
    "No, ML is always allowed."
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="GDPR explicitly creates an exception for statistical and research purposes (Article 5(1)(b)). As long as safeguards (like anonymization/pseudonymization) are used, this is generally **Compatible**."
/>

<MultipleChoice
  question="You collected email addresses to send receipts. Can you now sell them to a partner company?"
  options={[
    "Yes, data is an asset.",
    "Yes, if the partner is nice.",
    "No, unless you get fresh consent.",
    "No, unless the receipts were digital."
  ]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="Selling data is almost never 'Compatible' with the original purpose of service delivery. It is a new, separate purpose that requires its own legal basis (usually Consent)."
/>

## Practice: Pivot or Pause?

Bob is brainstorming new ways to use his data. Tell him which pivots are safe (Compatible) and which require a full stop (Incompatible).
