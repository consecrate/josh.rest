# The GDPR Awakening

It's 2016. Bob is struggling. The 1995 Directive is a mess.
*   In France, he has to register his database with the government.
*   In Germany, he needs a specific Data Protection Officer.
*   In Spain, the fines are different.

It's a nightmare of fragmentation. But then, good news (sort of). The EU announces the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.

## Directive vs. Regulation

The shift from the 1995 Directive to the 2016 GDPR (enforced in May 2018) was a massive legal upgrade.

### What is a Directive?
A **Directive** is a legislative act that sets out a **goal** that all EU countries must achieve. However, it is up to the individual countries to devise their own laws on how to reach these goals.
*   **Result**: 28 different variations of the law. (Fragmentation).

### What is a Regulation?
A **Regulation** is a binding legislative act. It must be applied in its entirety across the EU. It is "directly applicable."
*   **Result**: One single law for the entire EU. (Harmonization).

For Bob, this is actually better. He now has one set of rules to follow for all of Europe, instead of 28. But the rules are much stricter, and the fines are massive (up to 4% of global revenue).

<MultipleChoice
  question="Which legal instrument ensures that the law is exactly the same in every EU country?"
  options={[
    "A Directive",
    "A Regulation",
    "A Recommendation",
    "A Treaty"
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="A **Regulation** is directly applicable and uniform across all member states, unlike a Directive which requires local implementation."

<MultipleChoice
  question="DataVault Inc. is based entirely in Texas, USA. It has no offices in Europe. However, it sells a 'Premium Plan' to French customers in Euros. Does GDPR apply?"
  options={[
    "No, because the company is American.",
    "No, because it has no physical presence (offices) in the EU.",
    "Yes, because it is offering goods or services to data subjects in the EU.",
    "Yes, but only if the French government specifically sues them."
  ]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="This is the **Extraterritorial Scope** (Article 3). GDPR applies if you offer goods/services to, or monitor the behavior of, people in the EU, regardless of where your company is located."
/>

## Key Changes in GDPR

1.  **Harmonization**: One law for the continent.
2.  **Extraterritorial Scope**: It applies to anyone offering goods or services to people in the EU, even if the company (like DataVault) is based in the US.
3.  **Enforcement**: Drastically higher fines to ensure companies take it seriously.

## Practice: Directive or Regulation?

Can you distinguish between these two legal tools?
