# The Boss Principle

Bob is feeling good. He has a privacy policy, he secured the server, and he deleted the old data.
He tells Alice, "I am compliant!"
Alice says, "Prove it."

Bob points to the server. "Look, it's encrypted."
"That's not proof," Alice says. "Where is the documentation? Where is the risk assessment? Where is the policy document signed by the CEO?"

## Accountability

**Article 5(2)** is the "Accountability" principle. It says:
> The Controller shall be responsible for, and be able to **demonstrate compliance** with, paragraph 1.

This shifts the **Burden of Proof**.
*   Old World: The Regulator has to prove you broke the law.
*   New World (GDPR): **You** have to prove you followed it.

If you are doing everything right but haven't written it down, you are **not compliant**.

## The Tools of Accountability

How do you prove it? You create a paper trail (or a digital one).

### 1. ROPA (Record of Processing Activities)
A master spreadsheet that lists every data flow in your company.
*   *What data? Why? Where does it go? How long do we keep it?*

### 2. DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment)
A risk assessment for high-risk projects (like AI, biometrics, or large-scale tracking).
*   *What could go wrong? How do we mitigate it?*

### 3. DPO (Data Protection Officer)
An independent expert you hire to watch over the company. Required for Public Authorities and high-risk processors.

### 4. Privacy by Design
Building privacy into the product from Day 1, not bolting it on at the end.

## Practice: The Auditor

You are the DPA Auditor. Review Bob's situation and tell him which document or role he is missing.
