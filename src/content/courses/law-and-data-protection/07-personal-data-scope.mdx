# Is "User_ID_99" a Person?

Bob is busy optimizing his database schema. He looks at his `Users` table and feels pretty good.

"Alice," he says, "I'm not storing names anymore. I just use `User_ID` numbers and save their `Browser_Fingerprint` for security. So I don't have any 'personal data', right? I'm GDPR compliant!"

Alice sighs. "Bob, if you can use that ID to look up who they are, or if you can use that fingerprint to single them out from a crowd, it's personal data."

Bob is confused. "But it's just a number!"

## Defined: Personal Data

The GDPR defines **Personal Data** as any information relating to an **identified or identifiable natural person**.

- **Identified**: You know exactly who it is (e.g., "John Smith").
- **Identifiable**: You *could* figure out who it is using "reasonable means."

This is a massive scope. It includes:
- **Direct Identifiers**: Name, Passport Number, Email Address.
- **Indirect Identifiers**: IP Address, Cookie ID, RFID tag, Location Data.
- **Characteristics**: Physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity.

### The "Mosaic Effect"

Think of data like pieces of a puzzle. One piece (a zip code) might not identify someone. Another piece (gender) might not either. But if you combine:
- Zip Code: 90210
- Gender: Male
- Date of Birth: Jan 1, 1980
- Car Model: Tesla Model S

Suddenly, you might be looking at exactly one person. This ability to combine disparate data points to **single out** an individual makes all those points "personal data."

## What is NOT Personal Data?

To stop Bob from panicking completely, Alice explains what falls *outside* the scope:

1.  **Anonymous Data**: Information where the person is *irreversibly* unidentifiable. (We'll cover this more in Lesson 9).
2.  **Deceased Persons**: GDPR only protects living individuals. (Note: Some member states have their own laws for the deceased).
3.  **Legal Persons (Corporations)**: Information about "Acme Corp" (registration number, headquarters) is not personal data. However, `ceo@acme-corp.com` *is* personal data because it identifies the CEO.

<MultipleChoice
  question="Bob encrypts his user database with AES-256. He loses the USB stick with the database, but he keeps the decryption key safe. Is the data on the USB stick 'Personal Data'?"
  options={[
    "No, because it is encrypted and unreadable.",
    "Yes, it is Pseudonymised Personal Data.",
    "No, it is Anonymised.",
    "Yes, but only if the finder is a hacker."
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="It is **Pseudonymised Personal Data**. As long as a key exists *somewhere* to decrypt it, the data is not anonymous. However, because the key wasn't lost, the *risk* is low (and might not even require breach notification), but it is still technically Personal Data."
