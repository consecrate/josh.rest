# The "Creepy" Feature

Bob's app is growing. He decides to add a "Stalker Mode" (he calls it "Friend Tracker") that logs every user's location every 5 minutes to "improve the algorithm." He proudly shows it to Alice.

Alice recoils. "Bob, that's creepy. You can't just track people like that."

"But it's secure!" Bob argues. "I used AES-256 encryption. Nobody can steal the data. It's protected!"

Alice sighs. "Bob, you're confusing **Data Protection** (Security) with **Data Privacy**."

## Privacy vs. Data Protection (Security)

These two terms are often used interchangeably, but they mean very different things in the legal world.

### 1. Data Protection (Security)
This is about **guarding the vault**. It's the technical and organizational measures to keep data safe from unauthorized access, loss, or destruction.
*   **Focus**: Security, Integrity, Availability.
*   **Example**: Encryption, Firewalls, Backups, Access Logs.
*   **Bob's View**: "My database is unhackable."

### 2. Data Privacy
This is about **the user's rights**. It's about who is allowed to collect data, why, and how they use it. It's the right to be left alone and to control one's own information.
*   **Focus**: Rights, Consent, Transparency, Fairness.
*   **Example**: Asking for permission, collecting only what is needed, deleting data when asked.
*   **Alice's View**: "It doesn't matter if the vault is unhackable if you shouldn't have put my secrets in there in the first place."

<MultipleChoice
  question="If a hacker steals user passwords because the server wasn't patched, what kind of failure is this primarily?"
  options={[
    "Security Failure (Data Protection)",
    "Privacy Violation (Rights)",
    "Marketing Failure",
    "Feature Request"
  ]}
  correct={0}
  explanation="This is a **Security Failure**. The mechanism for protecting the data failed. While the result is a loss of privacy, the root cause is a failure of protection."

<MultipleChoice
  question="If a company sells your email address to a spammer without telling you, but uses a secure encrypted transfer to do it, what is this?"
  options={[
    "Security Failure",
    "Privacy Violation",
    "Network Error",
    "Database Optimization"
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="This is a **Privacy Violation**. The data was handled securely (encrypted), but the *use* of the data was unauthorized and violated your rights."
/>

## The Right to Privacy

Why does Alice care so much? Because Privacy is a fundamental human right. In Europe, it is often called the right to **Informational Self-Determination**—the right of an individual to decide for themselves when and within what limits their personal data is disclosed.

When Bob tracks users without a good reason, he is infringing on their freedom, even if he keeps the data "safe."
