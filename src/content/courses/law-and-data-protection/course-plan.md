# Course Plan: Law and Data Protection

## Course Metadata
- **Title**: Law and Data Protection for Developers: Bob's Startup Journey
- **Target Audience**: Computer Science students, Software Engineers, Entrepreneurs
- **Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of software development terms
- **Narrative Strategy**: "Bob's Startup Journey" - We follow Bob, a developer launching a tech startup called "DataVault." As he builds his product and company, he encounters specific legal and privacy challenges that correspond to the lesson topics. This contextualizes abstract legal concepts into practical engineering and business problems.

## Strategy
The course transforms dry legal theory into actionable knowledge by linking every concept to Bob's survival as a business owner. We start with the basics of law (why Bob can't just ignore rules), move to privacy fundamentals (why Bob's users care about their data), and then transition into the complex world of international data regulations (GDPR), setting the stage for deep dives.

## Module 1: The Foundation of Law
**Source Material**: Slides 1-18 (Basics of Law)

### Lesson 1: Bob vs. The Building Inspector (What is Law?)
- **Story**: Bob rents a garage for his startup servers. A building inspector cites him for code violations. Bob argues that "code is just guidelines." He learns the hard way about the binding nature of law versus social rules.
- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Define "Law" and distinguish it from other social rules (morality, tradition).
  - Understand the key characteristics: Binding nature, State authority, Enforcement.
- **Key Concepts**: Binding nature, Systematic structure, Social function, Enforcement mechanisms.
- **Source Mapping**: Slides 1-8.
- **Interactivity**: 
  - *Scenario*: "Is this a Law or a Rule?" dragging game (e.g., "Don't chew with mouth open" vs "Don't speed").

### Lesson 2: The Handshake Deal (Roles & Functions of Law)
- **Story**: Bob hires his first freelancer, Alice. He wants to just "shake on it." A dispute arises over who owns the code. Bob realizes law isn't just about punishment; it's about facilitating business (contracts) and resolving disputes.
- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Explain the roles of law: Regulatory, Protective, Facilitative, Dispute Resolution.
  - Discuss why society (and CS students) obey the law.
- **Key Concepts**: Facilitative role, Protective function, Dispute resolution, Intellectual Property (intro).
- **Source Mapping**: Slides 9-18.
- **Interactivity**:
  - *Quiz*: "Which Legal Function is This?" (Matching scenarios to roles like Protective or Facilitative).

## Module 2: Introduction to Data Privacy
**Source Material**: Slides 19-27 (Data Protection Basics)

### Lesson 3: The " creepy" Feature (Privacy vs. Data Protection)
- **Story**: Bob builds a feature that tracks user location history to "improve UX." Alice points out this feels invasive. They debate the difference between "protecting data" (security) and "privacy" (rights).
- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Define Data Protection and Personal Data.
  - Distinguish between Data Security (guarding the vault) and Data Privacy (rights of the user).
  - Understand the "Right to Privacy" (freedom from intrusion, control over info).
- **Key Concepts**: Personal Data, Privacy Rights, Informational Self-Determination, Confidentiality.
- **Source Mapping**: Slides 19-22.
- **Interactivity**:
  - *Case Study*: Analyze a feature request. Is it a security risk, a privacy violation, or both?

### Lesson 4: The Near Miss (Why Data Protection Matters)
- **Story**: A competitor, "LeakyApp," suffers a massive breach and goes bankrupt due to loss of trust and fines. Bob sweats. He needs to convince his investors to budget for data protection.
- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Articulate the business case for data protection: Trust, Risk Mitigation, Reputation, Legal Compliance.
  - Analyze the consequences of failure.
- **Key Concepts**: Trust & Confidence, Financial Risk, Cyber Threats, Legal Compliance.
- **Source Mapping**: Slides 23-27.
- **Interactivity**:
  - *Simulation*: "The Board Meeting" - Choose the best arguments to convince investors to fund security upgrades.

## Module 3: The Global Stage (Legal Frameworks)
**Source Material**: Slides 28-42 (History & Frameworks)

### Lesson 5: Going Global (Origins of EU Law)
- **Story**: Bob's app goes viral in Paris. He receives a formal letter referencing "Convention 108" and "ECHR." He realizes the internet has no borders, but laws do. He looks at the history to understand *why* Europe is so strict.
- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Trace the history of data protection from UN Declaration to EU frameworks.
  - Understand the significance of the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights) Article 8.
  - Differentiate between the Council of Europe (Convention 108) and the EU (GDPR).
- **Key Concepts**: UDHR Article 12, ECHR Article 8, Convention 108, Directive 95/46/EC.
- **Source Mapping**: Slides 28-40.
- **Interactivity**:
  - *Timeline Builder*: Drag and drop key legal events (1948 UDHR, 1980 Convention 108, 1995 Directive) into chronological order.

### Lesson 6: The GDPR Awakening (Transition to Modern Law)
- **Story**: Bob learns that the old "Directive" was replaced by the "Regulation" (GDPR) in 2018 to fix fragmentation. He prepares for the major overhaul of his systems.
- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Explain why the EU moved from a Directive (1995) to a Regulation (GDPR).
  - Identify the key shift: Harmonization across EU member states.
  - **Setup**: Tease the specific Articles of GDPR that will be covered in the next major course section.
- **Key Concepts**: Directive vs. Regulation, GDPR Enforcement (May 2018), Extraterritorial scope (intro).
- **Source Mapping**: Slides 41-42.
- **Interactivity**:
  - *Quiz*: "Directive or Regulation?" - Understanding the difference in binding power across member states.
