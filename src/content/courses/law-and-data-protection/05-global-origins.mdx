DataVault is a hit! Users are signing up from everywhere—including Paris, Berlin, and Rome.

Bob receives a formal letter from a French user asking to see all the data Bob holds on him, citing "The Law."

Bob is confused. "I'm an American company. Why do I care about French law?"

He consults a lawyer, who laughs. "The internet has no borders, Bob, but laws do. And if you want to do business in Europe, you play by European rules."

## Why is Europe So Strict?

To understand European law, you have to understand history. In the 20th century, Europe suffered under totalitarian regimes (fascism and communism) that used **state surveillance** to oppress people. Registers of names and addresses were used to round up dissidents and minorities.

As a result, in Europe, **Privacy is a Human Right** connected to dignity and safety. In the US, privacy is often treated more like a consumer protection issue (like truthful advertising).

## The Timeline of Data Rights

### 1948: Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)
After WWII, the UN declared in **Article 12** that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy."

### 1950: European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)
**Article 8** created a binding right to "respect for private and family life." This is the grandfather of all EU privacy laws.

### 1981: Convention 108
The Council of Europe passed the first legally binding international treaty specifically for automatic processing of personal data.

### 1995: The Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC)
The EU realized the early internet needed rules. They passed a "Directive" to set common standards across Europe. This was the law of the land until the GDPR came along.
