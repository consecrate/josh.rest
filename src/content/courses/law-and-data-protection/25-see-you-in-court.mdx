# Bob's Day in Court

Bob is being sued. 

Wait—wasn't there a complaint with the Supervisory Authority (Lesson 24)? Yes. But users have **two** paths. They can complain to the government, OR they can go straight to a judge.

## Two Types of Judicial Remedies

### 1. Suing the Supervisory Authority (Article 78)
If the SA ignores a complaint, or if the SA makes a decision that the user (or Bob!) hates, they can take the **SA to court**.
*   This usually happens in the Member State where the SA is established.

### 2. Suing the Controller or Processor (Article 79)
Users can sue Bob (the Controller) or his cloud provider (the Processor) directly for violating their rights.
*   **Where?** In the Member State where the company has an establishment, OR where the data subject lives.
*   **Exception:** If the controller is a **public authority** (like a government tax office), you usually must sue them in their own state's courts.

## The Role of the CJEU
Sometimes, a national judge isn't sure how to interpret the GDPR. They ask the **Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)** for help. This is called a **Preliminary Ruling**.

The CJEU doesn't decide if Bob is guilty. It just explains what the Law means. The national judge then takes that explanation and applies it to Bob's case.

<MultipleChoice
  question="If Bob's company is in Sweden and the user lives in Italy, where can the user sue Bob for a GDPR violation?"
  options={[
    "Only in Sweden.",
    "Only in Italy.",
    "Either Sweden or Italy.",
    "Only in the EU General Court in Luxembourg."
  ]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="Article 79 gives the data subject the choice to sue in the state of the controller's establishment OR their own habitual residence."

<MultipleChoice
  question="What is a 'Preliminary Ruling' by the CJEU?"
  options={[
    "A final verdict on whether Bob must pay a fine.",
    "An interpretation of EU law requested by a national court to help them decide a case.",
    "A secret meeting between judges.",
    "A warning issued to a company before they are sued."
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="When a national court is uncertain about GDPR interpretation, they refer questions to the CJEU. The CJEU provides the 'ruling' on the interpretation, which the national court then uses."

## Practice: The Courtroom Maze

Should the case go to a local court, a different country, or do we need the CJEU?
