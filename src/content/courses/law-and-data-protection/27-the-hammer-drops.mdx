# The Reckoning

The Supervisory Authority has finished its investigation into Bob's "cat leak." They agree with the users: Bob was negligent. Now comes the part everyone fears: **The Fine**.

## The Two Tiers of Fines (Article 83)

The GDPR doesn't just have one fine. It has two "tiers" depending on what you did wrong.

### Tier 1: The "Small" Fine (€10,000,000 or 2%)
Up to **€10 million** or **2%** of total worldwide annual turnover (whichever is higher).
*   **Applies to:** Minor administrative violations (e.g., failing to keep records of processing, failing to perform a Privacy Impact Assessment).

### Tier 2: The "Big" Fine (€20,000,000 or 4%)
Up to **€20 million** or **4%** of total worldwide annual turnover (whichever is higher).
*   **Applies to:** Serious breaches of core principles (e.g., violating data subject rights, lack of legal basis, illegal transfers to third countries).

## How is the amount decided?
The SA doesn't just pick a number. They must consider **11 factors** (Article 83(2)):
1.  **Nature, gravity, and duration** of the infringement.
2.  **Intentional or negligent** character.
3.  **Mitigation** (did Bob try to fix it quickly?).
4.  **Cooperation** with the SA.
5.  **Previous infringements**.

> [!TIP]
> Fines must be **effective, proportionate, and dissuasive**. They are meant to hurt enough that companies don't just treat them as a "cost of doing business."
