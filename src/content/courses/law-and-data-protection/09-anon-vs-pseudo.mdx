# Bob's Loophole

Panicked by the strict rules for Special Categories, Bob decides to "fix" his database.

"I've solved it!" Bob announces. "I ran all the email addresses through a hashing algorithm. Now `bob@example.com` is just `5e8848...`. It's anonymous! GDPR doesn't apply anymore!"

Alice shakes her head. "Bob, that's not anonymous. That's **pseudonymous**. And yes, GDPR still applies."

## The Distinction

This is one of the most common misunderstandings in tech.

### Pseudonymisation (GDPR Applies)
- **Definition**: Processing personal data so it can no longer be attributed to a specific subject *without the use of additional information* (like a key).
- **Key Feature**: **Reversible**. If you have the key, or if you can brute-force the hash, you get the data back.
- **Status**: It is a **security measure** (good!), but it is still personal data.
- **Example**: Hashing passwords, replacing names with User IDs, encrypting a database.

### Anonymisation (GDPR Exempt)
- **Definition**: Processing personal data so the subject is **identifiable no longer**.
- **Key Feature**: **Irreversible**. It must be impossible (or unreasonably difficult) for *anyone* (including you) to re-identify the person.
- **Status**: It is **no longer personal data**. GDPR rules vanish.
- **Example**: Aggregated statistics ("50% of visitors are from France"), effectively blurred faces where the original footage is destroyed.

## The Risk of Re-identification

Bob argues, "But I threw away the salt!"

Alice counters, "But can you guarantee that no one can ever link this data back? What if they cross-reference it with another leaked database?"

If there is a "reasonable means" to re-identify the user—even by combining it with outside data—it is not anonymous. It is pseudonymous.
