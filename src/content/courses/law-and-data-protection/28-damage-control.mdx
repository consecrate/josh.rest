# Beyond the Money

Bob thinks that if he pays the fine (Lesson 27), he's done. Alice laughs. "The fine is just the beginning, Bob. They can make you stop working entirely."

## Corrective Powers (Article 58)

The Supervisory Authority (SA) has a toolbox of "Corrective Powers" to make sure companies actually fix their problems. Fines are just one tool.

### The Toolbox
1.  **Warnings**: "Don't do that, or we'll investigate you." (Usually for planned processing).
2.  **Reprimands**: "You did it wrong, don't do it again." (For past minor violations).
3.  **Orders to Comply**: "You must respect the user's request for access within 7 days."
4.  **Bans**: A temporary or permanent **limitation or ban on processing**. This is the nuclear option.
5.  **Suspension of Data Flows**: "Stop sending data to the US until you have safeguards."

## The Non-Profit Watchdogs (Article 80)
Bob should also watch out for non-profits. Organizations like NOYB (None of Your Business) can be **mandated by data subjects** to lodge complaints or take legal action on their behalf. 

In some countries, these organizations can even act **without a mandate** if they see a systemic violation!

> [!CAUTION]
> A Processing Ban can kill a business faster than a fine. Imagine if DataVault was banned from processing *all* pet data for 30 days.

<MultipleChoice
  question="The Supervisory Authority discovers that Bob's 'Security' is non-existent. They order him to 'bring processing operations into compliance' within 30 days. What power is this?"
  options={[
    "A warning.",
    "A reprimand.",
    "An order to comply.",
    "A permanent ban."
  ]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="Article 58(2)(d) gives the SA the power to order the controller to bring processing operations into compliance with the GDPR."
/>

<MultipleChoice
  question="Can a non-profit organization sue Bob for a GDPR violation even if NO single user has complained to them?"
  options={[
    "No, they must be hired by a specific victim.",
    "Yes, if the Member State's law allows for 'representative actions' without a mandate.",
    "Only if they pay Bob first.",
    "Only if the violation involves more than 1,000,000 people."
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="Article 80(2) allows Member States to provide that organizations can lodge complaints/judicial remedies independently of a data subject's mandate if they believe rights have been infringed."
