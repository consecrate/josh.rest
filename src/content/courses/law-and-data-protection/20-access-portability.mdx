# Bob's Nightmare

An email arrives:
> "Subject: SAR
> Dear DataVault,
> Please provide a copy of all personal data you hold about me."

Bob laughs. "Ignore it."
Alice grabs his mouse. "Bob, that is a **Subject Access Request (SAR)**. If you ignore it, we get fined."

Bob panics. "Do I send them the database schema? The server logs? The backups?"

## Right of Access (Article 15)

The Right of Access is the gateway right. It allows users to verify what you are doing.
You must provide:
1.  **Confirmation**: "Yes, we have your data."
2.  **A Copy**: The actual data itself.
3.  **Context**: The same info from the Privacy Notice (Purpose, Retention, etc.).

**The Rules:**
*   **Free of charge** (usually).
*   **Within 1 month**.
*   **Electronic format** (if requested by email).

<MultipleChoice
  question="Can Bob charge a $10 'Admin Fee' for handling a standard Access Request?"
  options={[
    "Yes, to cover his time.",
    "Yes, but only for paper copies.",
    "No, it must be free (unless the request is excessive).",
    "No, never."
  ]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="Article 12(5) states that information provided under Articles 13-22 must be provided **free of charge**. Fees are only allowed for 'manifestly unfounded or excessive' requests (e.g., asking for the same thing every week)."
/>

<MultipleChoice
  question="A user demands their data in 'Ancient Sumerian Cuneiform' format. Must Bob comply?"
  options={[
    "Yes, the customer is always right.",
    "No, Article 20 only requires a 'structured, commonly used and machine-readable format'.",
    "Yes, if he has a clay tablet printer.",
    "No, he can refuse the request entirely."
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="Bob can refuse the format. He must provide it in a standard format like CSV, JSON, or XML. He does not need to support obscure or dead languages."
/>

## Right to Data Portability (Article 20)

Then, a second email arrives from a user who wants to switch to Bob's competitor, "DataBin".
> "Please send my data to DataBin in a format they can import."

Bob is angry. "Why should I help them leave?"
"Because," Alice says, "it's their data, not yours."

The Right to Portability applies when:
1.  Processing is based on **Consent** or **Contract**.
2.  AND processing is **automated**.

You must provide the data in a format that is:
*   **Structured**
*   **Commonly Used**
*   **Machine-Readable**

(Think CSV, JSON, XML. Not PDF, not screenshots, not paper).

## Practice: The Format Checker

Bob is trying to be "technically compliant" but practically annoying. Help him choose the format that actually satisfies Article 20.
