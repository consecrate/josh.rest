# The Gatekeeper

Bob is building the login system for DataVault. He wants it to be secure, but he also wants it to be easy.

"I'll just ask for a password," Bob says.
"That's weak," says Alice.
"Okay, password and a secret question: 'What is your dog's name?'"
"Still weak. Those are both the same *kind* of factor."

## Identification vs. Authentication

First, let's distinguish:
- **Identification**: Telling the system *who* you are (e.g., typing your username). "I am User 99."
- **Authentication**: *Proving* that you are who you claim to be. "Here is the password for User 99."

## The Three Factors of Authentication

To prove identity, you generally use one (or more) of three factors:

### 1. Knowledge (Something you KNOW)
- Passwords
- PIN codes
- Secret answers ("Mother's maiden name")
- **Weakness**: Can be guessed, phished, or shared.

### 2. Possession (Something you HAVE)
- A physical key
- A smartphone (receiving an SMS or app notification)
- A smart card / ID badge
- A USB security key (YubiKey)
- **Weakness**: Can be stolen or lost.

### 3. Inherence (Something you ARE)
- Fingerprint
- Face recognition
- Iris scan
- Voice print
- **Weakness**: Cannot be changed if compromised (you can't change your fingerprints!). Also, this is often **Biometric Data** (Article 9 Special Category), so it requires careful handling.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Secure systems use **Multi-Factor Authentication**. This means using **two different factors**.
- **Good MFA**: Password (Knowledge) + Phone Code (Possession).
- **Bad MFA**: Password (Knowledge) + Secret Question (Knowledge). This is just "Two-Step" verification, not "Multi-Factor."

<MultipleChoice
  question="Bob secures his admin panel with a password and a secret question ('What is your mother's maiden name?'). Is this Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?"
  options={[
    "Yes, because there are two steps.",
    "No, because both are 'Knowledge' factors.",
    "Yes, but it is weak MFA.",
    "No, because he didn't use a fingerprint."
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="MFA requires **two different categories** of factors (Knowledge, Possession, Inherence). A password and a secret question are BOTH Knowledge. This is 'Two-Step Verification', not MFA."
