# The Menu

After the "Email List Fiasco," Bob is cautious. He wants to process data correctly.
"So I need to ask for permission for *everything*?" he asks.

Alice shakes her head. "No. That's a common myth. 'Consent' is just one item on the menu. There are **6 Lawful Bases** in Article 6. You must choose the right one for the job."

Think of it like a buffet. You can't take everything; you have to pick the one plate that fits your hunger (purpose).

## The 6 Lawful Bases

### 1. Contract (The "Business Deal")
*   **When to use**: You need the data to fulfill a contract with the user, or to take steps at their request before entering a contract.
*   **Example**: Delivering a package, processing a credit card payment, paying an employee.
*   **Why**: If they don't give you the address, you can't ship the item. It's necessary.

### 2. Legal Obligation (The "Law Made Me Do It")
*   **When to use**: You are required by *another* law (not GDPR) to process data.
*   **Example**: Sending salary data to the tax office, performing KYC (Know Your Customer) checks for banking, keeping invoices for tax audits.
*   **Note**: This must be a statutory obligation, not just a contractual one.

### 3. Vital Interests (The "Life Saver")
*   **When to use**: To protect someone's life.
*   **Example**: An unconscious car crash victim arrives at the ER. The hospital searches their ID for allergies.
*   **Limit**: Only for life-or-death situations where consent is impossible.

### 4. Public Task (The "Official Duty")
*   **When to use**: You are a public authority (or acting as one) performing an official function.
*   **Example**: Tax collection, garbage collection, police work, public health administration.
*   **Who**: Mostly government agencies.

### 5. Legitimate Interests (The "Balancing Act")
*   **When to use**: You have a valid interest (commercial, security, etc.) *AND* it doesn't override the user's rights.
*   **Example**: Fraud detection, network security, direct marketing (sometimes), personalized content.
*   **Requirement**: You must do a "Balancing Test" (LIA). Does your benefit outweigh their privacy risk?

### 6. Consent (The "Permission Slip")
*   **When to use**: When none of the above apply, and you want to give the user a genuine choice.
*   **Example**: Sending a newsletter, tracking cookies, sharing data with third parties.
*   **Warning**: Consent is hard to get right (see next lesson). Don't use it if you don't need to!

## Bob's Mistake: "Consent Fatigue"

Bob originally tried to make users check a box saying "I Consent" for everything—shipping, billing, and login.
Alice explains: "Bob, if they uncheck the box, can you still ship the product?"
"No."
"Then it's not Consent. It's **Contract**. Don't ask for permission for things you *must* do. Just do them, and tell them about it."

<MultipleChoice
  question="Bob wants to process employee bank details to pay their monthly salary. Which lawful basis should he use?"
  options={[
    "Consent (Ask them nicely)",
    "Contract (Employment agreement)",
    "Vital Interests (They need money to eat)",
    "Legitimate Interests (Bob likes paying people)"
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="The correct basis is Contract. Paying the salary is a core part of the employment contract. Asking for consent is dangerous because if they say 'No', you still have to pay them!"
/>

<MultipleChoice
  question="A private investigator wants to track a person's location to see if they are cheating on their spouse. He claims 'Legitimate Interests' (serving his client). Is this valid?"
  options={[
    "Yes, the client has a right to know.",
    "No, the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject (privacy) override this commercial interest.",
    "Yes, if he doesn't get caught.",
    "No, unless the spouse consents."
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="Legitimate Interests requires a **Balancing Test**. The intrusive nature of tracking (stalking) clearly overrides the commercial interest of the PI. It is unlawful."
/>

## Practice: Match the Basis

Help Bob categorize his processing activities into the correct Lawful Basis.
