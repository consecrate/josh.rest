# The Triad

Bob is excited. He just bought a list of 10,000 email addresses from a vendor called "MegaDataCorp".

"I'm going to send them all an invite to DataVault!" Bob says.
"Did they agree to receive emails from you?" Alice asks.
"No, but I paid for the list! That makes it legal, right?"

Alice sighs. "Bob, paying for data doesn't make it lawful. And even if it were technically legal, it would still be unfair."

Bob has just run into **Article 5(1)(a)** of the GDPR, the "Golden Rule" of data protection. It states that personal data must be processed:
1.  **Lawfully**
2.  **Fairly**
3.  **Transparently**

These three principles are distinct but interconnected. Failing one means failing all.

## 1. Lawfulness (The "Ticket")

**Lawfulness** means you have a legal right to process the data. You can't just process data because you want to; you need a valid legal basis (like Consent, Contract, or Legal Obligation).

Think of it like a train ticket. You need a valid ticket (Legal Basis) to get on the train (Process Data). If you don't have one, you are a stowaway (Illegal Processing).

> Bob's mistake: Buying an email list usually lacks a valid legal basis because the people on that list never consented to their data being sold to *him*.

## 2. Fairness (The "Creep Factor")

**Fairness** is about expectations. Even if you have a legal basis, you cannot process data in a way that is detrimental, unexpected, or misleading to the data subject.

A good test for fairness is the **"Reasonable Expectation" test**:
*   *Would a user be surprised to learn you are doing this?*
*   *If they knew, would they feel manipulated or harmed?*

> Bob's mistake: Even if the list vendor claimed they had "consent," sending unsolicited emails to people who have never heard of you is unexpected and intrusive. It fails the fairness test.

### Adverse Effects
Fairness also looks at **Adverse Effects**. Are you using data to harm people?
*   **Price Discrimination**: Charging Mac users more than PC users.
*   **Exclusion**: Using data to exclude people from insurance or loans without justification.
*   **Manipulation**: Using psychological triggers to force users to stay on an app.

## 3. Transparency (The "No Surprises" Rule)

**Transparency** means being open and honest about what you are doing. You must tell people *who* you are, *what* you are collecting, *why*, and *who* you are sharing it with.

This is usually done via a **Privacy Policy** (or Privacy Notice). But it's not enough to just have a policy; it must be:
*   Concise
*   Intelligible
*   Easily accessible
*   Written in plain language

> Bob's mistake: If he emails these people, they will ask: "How did you get my email?" If he can't give a clear, honest answer, he lacks transparency.

<MultipleChoice
  question="Which of these scenarios best illustrates a violation of 'Fairness' (even if it might be technically lawful)?"
  options={[
    "Sending a receipt to a customer after they buy a product.",
    "Using a flashlight app's permission to harvest location data for advertisers.",
    "Deleting user data after they cancel their account.",
    "Asking for a password to log in."
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="This is a classic Fairness violation. While the user might have technically 'consented' by clicking 'Allow', it is deceptive and outside their reasonable expectations for a flashlight app."

## Practice: The Fairness Meter

Bob is still confused about the difference between "Legal" and "Fair." Help him evaluate these scenarios.
