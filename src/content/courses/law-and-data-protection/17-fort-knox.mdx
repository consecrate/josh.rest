# The Open Door

Bob leaves his laptop open on the cafe table while he goes to order a latte.
Alice walks by, closes it, and glares at him.
"That," she says, "was a data breach."

## The Security Principle

**Article 5(1)(f)** requires data to be processed in a manner that ensures **appropriate security**. This includes protection against:
*   Unauthorized or unlawful processing (Hacking, spying).
*   Accidental loss, destruction, or damage (Fires, bugs, deleting the wrong file).

This is often called the **Integrity and Confidentiality** principle, but in security circles, we call it the **CIA Triad**.

### 1. Confidentiality (The "Secret")
Only authorized people should see the data.
*   **Threats**: Hackers, lost laptops, nosey employees, phishing.
*   **Defense**: Encryption, Access Controls, NDAs.

### 2. Integrity (The "Truth")
The data should not be altered or corrupted.
*   **Threats**: Malware, buggy code, SQL injection, disk errors.
*   **Defense**: Checksums, backups, immutable logs, input validation.

### 3. Availability (The "Access")
The data must be available when needed.
*   **Threats**: Ransomware, DDoS attacks, power outages, fires.
*   **Defense**: Backups, Disaster Recovery Plans, Redundant servers.

## Risk-Based Approach

You don't need Fort Knox security for a grocery list. But you do for medical records.
The GDPR says you must implement **"Technical and Organizational Measures" (TOMs)** appropriate to the **risk**.

*   **Technical**: Encryption, Firewalls, Multi-Factor Authentication.
*   **Organizational**: Training, Policies, Physical security (locking doors).

<MultipleChoice
  question="Which of these is an 'Organizational' security measure?"
  options={[
    "Encrypting the hard drive.",
    "Installing a firewall.",
    "Training employees on how to spot phishing emails.",
    "Using HTTPS."
  ]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="Encryption, Firewalls, and HTTPS are Technical measures (software/hardware). Training is an Organizational measure (people/processes). You need both."

<MultipleChoice
  question="Bob's server has perfect encryption, but he uses 'password123' as the admin password. Which principle is compromised?"
  options={[
    "Confidentiality (due to weak access control)",
    "Integrity",
    "Availability",
    "Transparency"
  ]}
  correct={0}
  explanation="Weak passwords allow unauthorized access, compromising **Confidentiality**. Security is only as strong as its weakest link."
