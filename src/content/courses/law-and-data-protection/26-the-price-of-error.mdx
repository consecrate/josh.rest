# Bob's Wallet is Crying

Bob thinks that if he didn't *steal* the users' money, he shouldn't have to pay them anything. Alice corrections him.

"In the EU, Bob, privacy is a fundamental right. If you break it, you pay."

## Right to Compensation (Article 82)

Any person who has suffered **material or non-material damage** as a result of an infringement of the GDPR has the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor.

### What counts as "Damage"?
1.  **Material Damage**: Direct financial loss (e.g., identity theft led to money being stolen from a bank account).
2.  **Non-Material Damage**: Emotional harm, distress, or loss of control over your data (e.g., your private photos were leaked and you suffered anxiety).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The concept of damage should be **broadly interpreted**. Even "mere loss of control" over data can be enough to claim compensation in some cases.

## Who Pays?
*   **Controllers** are liable for any damage caused by processing that infringes the GDPR.
*   **Processors** are liable ONLY if they ignored the controller's instructions or violated processor-specific GDPR rules (like security).

### Joint and Several Liability
If multiple companies (e.g., Bob and his Cloud Provider) are involved in the same processing that caused damage, **each is liable for the entire damage**. The user can sue either one for 100% of the money.
*   The company that pays can then sue the other one to "claim back" their fair share of the cost.

<MultipleChoice
  question="A user's home address was leaked from DataVault. They didn't lose any money, but they felt 'extremely distressed and unsafe.' Can they claim compensation?"
  options={[
    "No, compensation is only for financial loss.",
    "Yes, this is 'non-material damage' and is covered by Article 82.",
    "Only if they can prove the leak was intentional.",
    "Only if Bob is a public authority."
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="Article 82 specifically includes 'non-material damage' (like distress or loss of reputation). You don't have to lose money to get compensated."

<MultipleChoice
  question="Bob's developer accidentally leaked data. Bob says: 'It's not my fault, it was the developer!' What does the GDPR say about his liability?"
  options={[
    "Bob is exempt if he can prove the developer was negligent.",
    "Bob is exempt only if he fired the developer.",
    "Bob is liable unless he proves he is 'not in any way responsible' for the event giving rise to the damage.",
    "Bob is only liable for 50% of the damage."
  ]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="Under Article 82(3), the controller is exempt only if they prove they are *not in any way* responsible. This is a very high bar to meet."
