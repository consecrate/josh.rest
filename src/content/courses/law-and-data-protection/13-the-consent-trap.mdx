# "I Agree"

Bob decides that "Legitimate Interests" is too complicated (too much paperwork). He goes back to Consent.
He creates a signup form with a pre-ticked box:
`[x] I agree to the Terms of Service and to receive daily marketing emails.`

Alice takes one look and deletes the code.
"Bob, that's not consent. That's a trap."

## The 4 Conditions of Valid Consent

Under Article 7 and Recital 32, consent is not just a checkbox. It must meet four strict criteria to be valid. If it fails even one, it's **invalid** (meaning you are processing illegally).

### 1. Freely Given (No Coercion)
The user must have a *genuine choice*.
*   **The Problem**: "Bundling." saying "Sign up for our service (and we will also sell your data)."
*   **The Rule**: You cannot make consent a condition of service unless the data is *necessary* for that service.
*   **Power Imbalance**: Employees usually cannot freely give consent to employers because they fear being fired.

### 2. Specific (Granularity)
Consent must be for a specific purpose. You can't ask for "General Permission."
*   **The Problem**: "I agree to data processing." (Too vague!)
*   **The Rule**: Separate checkboxes for separate purposes.
    *   `[ ] Terms of Service` (Contract)
    *   `[ ] Marketing Emails` (Consent)
    *   `[ ] Share with Partners` (Consent)

### 3. Informed (No Legalese)
The user must know *what* they are agreeing to.
*   **The Problem**: Buried in page 45 of a PDF.
*   **The Rule**: Clear, plain language. Identify the controller (you) and the purposes.

### 4. Unambiguous (The "Clear Act")
Consent requires a clear affirmative action.
*   **The Problem**: Pre-ticked boxes (`[x]`), Silence, Inactivity, "By continuing to use..."
*   **The Rule**: The user must *do* something to consent (click, check, sign). **Silence is not consent.**

## The Right to Withdraw

> "It must be as easy to withdraw consent as to give it." (Article 7(3))

If it took one click to join, it must take one click to leave. You cannot make them call a phone number or send a fax to unsubscribe.

<MultipleChoice
  question="Bob's gym requires members to scan their fingerprint to enter 'for security'. Is this valid Consent?"
  options={[
    "Yes, if they sign a form.",
    "No, because the imbalance of power implies it's not 'Freely Given' if they have no other way to enter.",
    "Yes, because it's a private club.",
    "No, fingerprints are illegal."
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="If the user *must* consent to access the service, and the data (fingerprint) isn't strictly necessary (a keycard would work), the consent is not **Freely Given** and is invalid."
/>

<MultipleChoice
  question="Which of these is a valid example of GDPR consent?"
  options={[
    "A pre-ticked box saying 'Send me offers'.",
    "A mandatory checkbox 'I agree to marketing' to create an account.",
    "An empty checkbox 'I would like to receive the newsletter' that the user must click.",
    "A sentence in the footer: 'By browsing this site you agree to cookies'."
  ]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="Only the empty checkbox requires a 'Clear Affirmative Action' (Unambiguous) and offers a choice (Freely Given). Pre-ticked boxes and implied consent are banned."
/>

## Practice: Valid or Void?

Bob is trying to design his forms again. Help him identify which consent flows are valid and which are traps.
