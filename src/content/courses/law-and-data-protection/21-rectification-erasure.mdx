# Bob's Permanent Record

Bob loves data. He never deletes anything. "Storage is cheap!" he says.
But then a user writes: "I got married. My name is now Alice Smith, not Alice Jones. Fix it."
Bob groans. "Database updates are hard."
**Article 16 (Right to Rectification)**: You *must* correct inaccurate data without undue delay.

Then another user writes: "I'm leaving. Delete everything."
Bob panics. "But I need their transaction history for my charts!"
**Article 17 (Right to Erasure / Right to be Forgotten)**: You *must* delete data if...
*   It's no longer necessary.
*   Consent is withdrawn.
*   They object (and you have no overriding grounds).
*   It was unlawful to begin with.

## It's Not Absolute

Bob thinks, "Wait, if someone commits a crime on my platform and then asks to be deleted, do I have to destroy the evidence?"

**NO.** The Right to Erasure has big exceptions:
1.  **Freedom of Expression** (Journalism).
2.  **Legal Obligation** (Tax laws require keeping invoices).
3.  **Public Interest** (Public health).
4.  **Legal Claims** (If you are being sued).

<MultipleChoice
  question="A user demands deletion of their account. However, DataVault is currently suing that user for unpaid fees. Must Bob delete the data?"
  options={[
    "Yes, the Right to be Forgotten is absolute.",
    "Yes, but he can keep a backup.",
    "No, he can keep it for the 'establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims'.",
    "No, because he owns the data."

  correct={2}
  explanation="Article 17(3)(e) provides an exception for data necessary for legal claims. Bob can keep the data relevant to the lawsuit."

<MultipleChoice
  question="Bob's backup tapes are read-only and technically impossible to edit individually. A user asks for rectification of a typo. What should Bob do?"
  options={[
    "Destroy all backups immediately.",
    "Ignore the request.",
    "Rectify the live system, and ensure the error is corrected if a backup is ever restored.",
    "Tell the user to wait 10 years."
  ]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="Regulators understand technical limits. You don't have to destroy backups to fix a typo, but you must ensure the live system is fixed and that the error doesn't reappear during a restore ('put it on the list')."

## Practice: The Erasure Judge

Bob is reviewing deletion requests. Some are valid, some are blocked by exceptions. You be the judge.
