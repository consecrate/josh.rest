# The Handshake Deal

Bob finds a new office. He needs a logo for "DataVault." He meets a talented designer named Alice at a coffee shop.

"I'll design your logo for $500," Alice says.

"Deal!" Bob says. They shake hands. No paperwork. "We're friends, right? Who needs lawyers?"

Two weeks later, Alice delivers a great logo. Bob pays her.
But then, Bob puts the logo on t-shirts and starts selling them.

Alice calls him, furious. "I only sold you the *license* to use it on the website! You can't sell merch with my art!"

Bob is confused. "But I paid for it!"

They are now in a dispute. Bob realizes that **Law** does more than just punish criminals. It plays several critical roles in his business life.

## The Roles of Law

Law serves four main functions in society (and in Bob's startup):

### 1. Regulatory Role
This is what Bob encountered with the building inspector.
*   **Function**: Setting standards and prohibiting harmful conduct.
*   **Example**: Speed limits, building codes, banning toxic waste dumping.
*   **For Bob**: Laws that say he can't sell user data to criminals.

### 2. Protective Role
Law protects the weak from the strong.
*   **Function**: Safeguarding rights and vulnerable groups.
*   **Example**: Human rights laws, labor laws, consumer protection.
*   **For Bob**: Laws that prevent a monopoly from crushing his small startup unfairly.

### 3. Facilitative Role
This is where Bob and Alice messed up.
*   **Function**: Enabling transactions and economic activity.
*   **Example**: Contract law, corporate law, property law.
*   **For Bob**: The law provides a framework (contracts) so strangers can trust each other enough to do business. If Bob and Alice had a written contract, the law would have *facilitated* their deal by making the terms clear and enforceable.

### 4. Dispute Resolution
Now that they are fighting, they need a referee.
*   **Function**: Providing peaceful conflict resolution mechanisms.
*   **Example**: Courts, arbitration, mediation.
*   **For Bob**: Instead of a duel at dawn, Bob and Alice go to small claims court (or mediation) to settle who owns the copyright.

## Why CS Students Need Law

Bob might think, "I'm a coder, not a lawyer." But as "DataVault" grows, every line of code interacts with the legal system.

1.  **Intellectual Property (IP)**: Who owns the code? The logo? (Alice's case).
2.  **Privacy & Data Protection**: Can Bob track users? (GDPR, which we will study soon).
3.  **Liability**: If Bob's code has a bug and a bank loses millions, is Bob responsible?
4.  **Cybercrime**: If Bob hacks back a hacker, is he a criminal?

<MultipleChoice
  question="Bob wants to use a cool library he found on GitHub. He checks the LICENSE file and sees it is 'GPL'. This forces him to open-source his own code if he uses it. This is an example of:"
  options={[
    "Criminal Law",
    "Intellectual Property & Licensing",
    "Data Protection Law",
    "Labor Law"
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="This is <strong>Intellectual Property</strong> law. Software licenses rely on copyright law to dictate how code can be used and shared."

## Dispute Resolution: The Verdict

Bob and Alice go to mediation. The mediator explains that under Copyright Law, the creator (Alice) owns the rights unless they are explicitly transferred in writing. Since there was no written contract saying "Work for Hire," Alice still owns the copyright.

Bob has to pay Alice extra for the merchandise rights.

**Lesson Learned**: The **Facilitative** role of law (contracts) only works if you use it! Bob vows to always have written agreements from now on.
