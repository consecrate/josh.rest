# Bob's Bad Day

Bob's "DataVault" app is growing fast, but so are the mistakes. Last week, a glitch in the "Pet Health" module accidentally leaked the medical records of thousands of cats to a public forum.

Bob expects an angry email. Instead, he gets a letter from the **Supervisory Authority (SA)**.

A user didn't bother talking to Bob. They went straight to the government.

## The Right to Complain (Article 77)

Every data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if they believe the processing of their personal data infringes the GDPR.

### Where can they file it?
The user has options. They can file the complaint in the Member State of:
1.  **Their Habitual Residence** (where they live).
2.  **Their Place of Work**.
3.  **The Place of the Alleged Infringement** (where the leak happened).

> [!NOTE]
> Supervisory authorities must make it easy. Most have electronic submission forms.

## Investigation and Outcome
The SA must:
*   **Investigate** the complaint to the extent necessary.
*   **Inform** the complainant on the progress and the outcome of the complaint.

If the SA doesn't act or inform the user within 3 months, the user has the right to a **judicial remedy** (taking the SA to court!).
