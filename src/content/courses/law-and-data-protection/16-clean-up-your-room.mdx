# Digital Hoarding

Bob discovers a hard drive in the office closet labeled "Backups 2005".
"This is history!" he says.
"This is a ticking time bomb," says Alice.

## Two Principles in One

This lesson covers two related principles:
1.  **Accuracy** (Article 5(1)(d))
2.  **Storage Limitation** (Article 5(1)(e))

## 1. Accuracy
Data must be **accurate** and, where necessary, **kept up to date**.
*   If a user moves house, you must update their address.
*   If a user disputes a debt, you must correct the record if they are right.
*   Incorrect data leads to incorrect decisions (e.g., shipping to the wrong house, denying a loan by mistake).

**The Right to Rectification**: Users have the right to ask you to fix their data. You must do it without delay.

## 2. Storage Limitation
Data must be kept **no longer than is necessary** for the purposes for which it is processed.

**You cannot keep data "forever" just because storage is cheap.**
Every piece of data must have an expiration date (a **Retention Period**).

### Retention Policies
You need a policy that defines how long you keep things.
*   **Tax Records**: Often 6-10 years (Legal Obligation).
*   **CCTV**: Often 30 days (Security vs Privacy balance).
*   **User Accounts**: Until deleted + maybe 30 days grace period.
*   **Marketing Lists**: Until they unsubscribe.

### The Exception: Archiving
You *can* keep data longer for:
*   Public interest archiving
*   Scientific/Historical research
*   Statistical purposes
...but only if you implement safeguards (like anonymization).

<MultipleChoice
  question="A user cancels their subscription and deletes their account. What should Bob do with their data?"
  options={[
    "Keep it forever in a 'Ghost' table.",
    "Delete it immediately (or after a short grace period), unless legally required to keep specific records (like invoices).",
    "Archive it on a public server.",
    "Sell it."
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="When the purpose ends (the user left), the data must be deleted. The only exception is if a law (like tax law) requires you to keep specific transaction records."
/>

## Practice: The Shredder

Bob is cleaning up the server. Help him decide which files to **Keep** and which to **Delete** based on the retention rules.
