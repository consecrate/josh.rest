# The Near Miss

Bob is still debating whether to delete the "Stalker Mode" feature when news breaks. A competitor, "LeakyApp," has suffered a massive data breach. Millions of user chats were leaked online because they stored them in plain text.

The consequences for LeakyApp are swift and brutal:
1.  **Fines**: Regulators fine them millions.
2.  **Churn**: Users delete the app in droves.
3.  **Stock Crash**: Investors pull out.
4.  **Lawsuits**: Users sue for damages.

Bob is terrified. He realizes that **Data Protection** isn't just a legal checkbox—it's an existential requirement for his business.

## The Business Case for Compliance

Bob needs to convince his investors to budget $50,000 for a security audit. He prepares his arguments. It's not just about avoiding fines; it's about building value.

### 1. Trust as a Currency
In the digital economy, **Trust** is the most valuable asset. If users trust you with their data, they will use your product. If they don't, you have no business.
*   **Example**: Apple positions "Privacy" as a luxury product feature to sell iPhones.

### 2. Risk Mitigation
Data breaches are expensive. The average cost of a data breach is in the millions (investigation, notification, legal fees, fines). Spending on prevention is cheaper than paying for a cure.

### 3. Market Access
If Bob wants to sell to big enterprise clients or operate in Europe, he *must* be compliant. Nobody will buy B2B software that isn't GDPR or SOC2 compliant.

## Simulation: The Board Meeting

Bob walks into the boardroom. The investors are skeptical. They want to spend money on ads, not security. Help Bob convince them.

<MultipleChoice
  question="Bob thinks: 'I'll just ask for forgiveness instead of permission. If I get caught, I'll pay the fine.' Why is this a bad strategy for Data Privacy?"
  options={[
    "Because fines are tax-deductible.",
    "Because once Trust is broken, it is almost impossible to regain. Users will leave forever.",
    "Because the police will arrest him immediately.",
    "Because his code will stop working."
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="While fines are bad, the **reputational damage** is often the business-killer. Trust is the currency of the digital economy."
