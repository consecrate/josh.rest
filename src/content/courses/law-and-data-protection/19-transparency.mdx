# Bob's Secret Recipe

Bob is proud of his app. He wants users to sign up quickly.
He adds a checkbox: "I agree to the Terms."
The "Terms" link goes to a 50-page PDF written in Latin (almost).

Alice stops him. "Bob, you can't do that."
"Why? Everyone does it!" Bob argues.
"Not under GDPR," Alice says. "Article 12 requires transparency. You must explain what you are doing in a way a human can actually understand."

## The Right to be Informed

The GDPR is built on the principle that people should know what is happening to their data. You cannot collect data in secret.

You must provide this information **at the time of collection** (if collecting directly from the user).

### Article 13 vs. Article 14

There are two lists of information you must provide, depending on where you got the data:

| **Article 13 (Direct Collection)** | **Article 14 (Indirect Collection)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| You ask the user for their data (e.g., signup form). | You buy a list or scrape data (e.g., from LinkedIn). |
| Provide info **immediately**. | Provide info within **one month** (or when you first contact them). |
| You already know the user (obviously). | You must tell the user **where you got the data**. |

<MultipleChoice
  question="Bob buys a marketing list from a data broker. Which Article applies?"
  options={[
    "Article 13 (Direct Collection)",
    "Article 14 (Indirect Collection)",
    "Neither, he doesn't need to tell them.",
    "Article 6 (Lawfulness)"
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="Since Bob obtained the data from a third party (the broker) and not the data subjects themselves, Article 14 applies. He must inform the users he has their data."
/>

<MultipleChoice
  question="Can Bob hide the 'Unsubscribe' link in white text on a white background?"
  options={[
    "Yes, it's a design choice.",
    "No, this violates Transparency and Fairness.",
    "Yes, if it's still clickable.",
    "No, it must be red."
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="Transparency requires information to be 'intelligible' and 'easily accessible'. Hiding the link is a 'Dark Pattern' and a violation."
/>

## What Must You Say? (The Checklist)

Whether it's Art 13 or 14, you must typically provide:

1.  **Identity**: Who are you? (Bob, CEO of DataVault)
2.  **Purpose**: Why do you want the data? (To ship the product)
3.  **Legal Basis**: Why is it legal? (Contract, Consent, Legitimate Interest)
4.  **Retention**: How long will you keep it? (Until you delete your account)
5.  **Rights**: What can the user do? (Access, Delete, Object)
6.  **Recipients**: Who else sees it? (AWS, Stripe, Mailchimp)
7.  **Transfers**: Is it leaving the EU?

### The Layered Approach

You can't dump all this in one wall of text. The GDPR encourages a **Layered Notice**:
*   **Layer 1**: Short, punchy summary (e.g., "We use cookies for analytics. [Read More]")
*   **Layer 2**: More detail on specific topics.
*   **Layer 3**: The full legal policy.

## Practice: The Notice Inspector

Bob has written a draft privacy notice. It's... not great. Can you spot what's missing?
