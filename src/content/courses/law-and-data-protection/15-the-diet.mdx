# Data Hoarding

Bob is designing his database schema. He adds columns for:
*   `user_id`
*   `email`
*   `password_hash`
*   `religion`
*   `shoe_size`
*   `mother_maiden_name`

"Bob," Alice asks. "Why do we need their shoe size?"
"You never know!" Bob says. "Data is the new oil! Maybe we'll sell shoes later."

Alice deletes the columns. "Data isn't oil, Bob. It's **toxic waste**. It's a liability. The more you hold, the more you can leak."

## Data Minimization

**Article 5(1)(c)** requires data to be:
1.  **Adequate**: Enough to do the job.
2.  **Relevant**: Directly related to the job.
3.  **Limited to what is necessary**: No "nice-to-haves."

This is the principle of **Data Minimization**. You should collect the *minimum* amount of data needed to achieve your specific purpose.

### Why Minimize?
1.  **Security**: If you don't have it, hackers can't steal it.
2.  **Accuracy**: Less data is easier to keep up-to-date.
3.  **Trust**: Users prefer apps that don't ask creepy questions.

## The "Nice-to-Have" Trap

Product managers often say: "Let's collect it just in case."
GDPR says: "If you don't have a specific use case *right now*, do not collect it."

> **Example**: A flashlight app needs permission to access the Flash/Camera. It does *not* need access to Contacts, Location, or Microphone.

<MultipleChoice
  question="Which of these follows the principle of Data Minimization?"
  options={[
    "Collecting Date of Birth for a Newsletter 'just in case' you want to send birthday emails later.",
    "Collecting precise GPS location for a Weather App.",
    "Collecting precise GPS location for a Calculator App.",
    "Collecting all photos on the phone for a Profile Picture upload."
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="A Weather App actually *needs* your location to function (to show local weather). That is adequate and relevant. A Calculator does not. Profile picture uploads should only access the specific photo selected, not the whole library."

<MultipleChoice
  question="Bob adds a 'Gender' field to the signup form because 'Marketing might want to target ads later'. The Marketing team currently has no specific plan to use it. Is this allowed?"
  options={[
    "Yes, it's better to have it and not need it.",
    "No, this violates Data Minimization (Necessity).",
    "Yes, if the field is optional.",
    "No, gender is banned."
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="You cannot collect data for hypothetical future purposes ('just in case'). If you don't have a specific, immediate purpose, you cannot collect it."
/>

## Practice: The Schema Audit

Review these data collection forms. Identify the field that violates Data Minimization.
