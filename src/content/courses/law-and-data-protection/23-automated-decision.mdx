# The LoanBot 3000

Bob is tired of manually approving user accounts. He builds "LoanBot 3000", an AI that looks at a user's zip code, browser history, and shoe size to decide if they get premium access.

Alice, a lawyer, applies. LoanBot 3000 says: **DENIED**.
Alice demands to know why.
Bob says: "I don't know, it's a neural network. It's a black box."
Alice says: "That's illegal."

## Article 22: Automated Individual Decision-Making

The user has the right **not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing** (including profiling), which produces **legal effects** or **similarly significant effects**.

### The Keywords

1.  **Solely Automated**: No human influence. (If a human rubber-stamps the AI's decision without looking, it's still considered automated).
2.  **Significant Effects**: Denying a loan, firing someone, refusing entry to a country. (Targeting an ad for shoes is usually *not* significant enough, though it can be).

### When is it Allowed?

Bob CAN use LoanBot if:
1.  It is **Necessary for entering a contract** (e.g., instant credit check).
2.  It is **Authorized by Law** (fraud prevention).
3.  He has **Explicit Consent**.

### The Safeguards

Even if allowed, Bob must provide:
*   **Human Intervention**: A way for Alice to appeal to a real person.
*   **Explanation**: Meaningful information about the "logic involved".

<MultipleChoice
  question="Which of these decisions is most likely to be regulated by Article 22?"
  options={[
    "Netflix recommending a movie.",
    "An algorithm deciding to terminate an Uber driver's account based on ratings.",
    "A spam filter moving an email to the Junk folder.",
    "A website changing its background color based on time of day."

  correct={1}
  explanation="Terminating employment or a contract is a 'legal or similarly significant effect'. Movie recommendations and spam filters (usually) do not rise to this level of severity."
